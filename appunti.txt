🍕 Pizza E-Commerce - Microservices ArchitectureWelcome to Pizza E-Commerce, a robust, scalable, and resilient backend ecosystem built on a modern microservices architecture. This project demonstrates production-grade implementation of event-driven communication, distributed data consistency, and containerized infrastructure.🏗️ System ArchitectureThe system consists of independent, decoupled microservices that communicate through a centralized API Gateway and an asynchronous Event Bus:API Gateway (Port 8080): The single entry point. It handles request routing, load balancing, and centralized JWT (JSON Web Token) validation.User Service (Port 8082): Manages identity, registration, and issues secure authentication tokens.Product Service (Port 8081): Manages the pizza catalog (categories, ingredients, pricing) and publishes state changes to Kafka.Cart Service (Port 8083): Handles real-time shopping cart management. It consumes Kafka events to ensure data consistency (e.g., clearing items when a product is deleted).Notification Service (Port 8084): The auditing and communication hub. It tracks system events and maintains a persistent audit log of all notifications.🛠️ Technology StackBackend: Java 21 & Spring Boot 3.4+Infrastructure:Docker & Docker Compose: Containerization and orchestration of all supporting services.Apache Kafka: Distributed event streaming platform for asynchronous messaging.MySQL: Relational persistence utilizing the Database-per-Service pattern.Security: Spring Security with a Stateless JWT model and Header Propagation.Build Tool: Maven.🔄 Event-Driven Design (Kafka)The project utilizes Apache Kafka to maintain eventual consistency across the distributed system without direct service coupling:User Registration: The User Service emits a user-registered event; the Notification Service consumes it to trigger welcome workflows and audit logs.Product Management: When a product is removed, the Product Service publishes a product-deleted event.The Cart Service consumes this to automatically sanitize active carts.The Notification Service consumes this to alert administrators of catalog changes.📂 Infrastructure & DockerizationThe entire infrastructure is orchestrated via Docker, ensuring a "plug-and-play" environment for developers. Each service owns its dedicated schema to prevent tight coupling:ServiceDatabase InstanceExternal PortUserpizza_user_db3309Productpizza_product_db3307Cartpizza_cart_db3308Notificationpizza_notification_db3310MessagingKafka Broker9092🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesDocker & Docker DesktopJDK 21+Maven 3.9+Setup & RunClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/pizza-ecommerce.git
Spin up the Infrastructure:Run the following command from the project root:Bashdocker-compose up -d
Application Configuration:Each microservice is pre-configured to connect to the Docker instances. Update application.properties only if you wish to change local port mappings.Launch Services:Run the services in the following order: User, Product, Cart, Notification, and API Gateway.🔐 Identity & Security FlowAuthentication: Client logs in via User Service and receives a signed JWT.Validation: The Gateway validates the JWT signature at the perimeter.Propagation: The Gateway extracts user metadata and injects it into a custom X-User-Email header.Downstream Logic: Internal services trust the Gateway-validated header, ensuring high performance by avoiding redundant token parsing.🛤️ Roadmap[x] Microservices Architecture & API Gateway Integration[x] Centralized JWT Authentication & Identity Propagation[x] Asynchronous Messaging with Apache Kafka[x] Full Infrastructure Dockerization[x] Persistent Notification Audit Log[ ] Order Service & Payment Integration[ ] Angular 17+ Reactive Frontend Development
